# Transforming Education: Predictive Models and Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to gain insights into student performance, predict scholarship eligibility, and assess academic risk. The project includes binary classification tasks using Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize students and predict their risk levels.

## Library and Module Imports
The project requires the following libraries and modules:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

## Binary Classification using Logistic Regression
The dataset is loaded, and Logistic Regression is applied for binary classification of student categories. The accuracy and classification report are printed for model evaluation.

## Binary Classification using FNN and MLP
Two neural network models, FNN and MLP, are trained on SGPA and CGPA data for binary classification. The accuracy of both models is evaluated on the test set.

## Student Risk Prediction using FNN and CNN
Logistic Regression and neural network models (FNN and MLP) are employed to predict student risk levels. The accuracy of each model is printed for evaluation.

## Visualization of SGPA and CGPA Trends
The academic performance trends of students are visualized by plotting SGPA and CGPA for each semester using matplotlib.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Execute the project code for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
